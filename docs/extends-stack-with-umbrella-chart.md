# What is a umbrella chart and why use it ?

An umbrella chart is a way of encapsulate multiple complex charts with one chart.

>Many of the charts in the CNCF Artifact Hub are "building blocks" for creating more advanced applications. But charts may be used to create instances of large-scale applications. In such cases, a single umbrella chart may have multiple subcharts, each of which functions as a piece of the whole.

>The current best practice for composing a complex application from discrete parts is to create a top-level umbrella chart that exposes the global configurations, and then use the charts/ subdirectory to embed each of the components.

Using an umbrella chart will allow you customize OpenEBS monitoring stack settings without modifying that chart content.  It's also easier to update a dependency.

To create your our umbrella chart, you will have a create a folder structure like this.

```
ðŸ“¦umbrella
â”£ ðŸ“œChart.yaml
â”— ðŸ“œvalues.yaml
```

| File               | Description                                                                      |
| ------             | ------                                                                           |
| Chart.yaml         | Contains your chart identification with a dependency to OpenEBS monitoring stack |
| values.yaml        | Contains all your settings values                                                |

# Umbrella chart with ingress and storage enabled

Here a example that will enable ingress and storage for OpenEBS monitoring stack.

In the file **Chart.yaml**, you will enter your umbrella chart information with a dependency to OpenEBS monitoring stack.  The property name : `condition` is optional.  That property will allow you to install that dependency or not depending of the value in `values.yaml`. 

#### Chart.yaml
````yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: monitoring-stack
description: Umbrella Chart for OpenEBS monitoring stack
icon: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20769039?s=200&v=4
type: application
version: 0.1.1
appVersion: 1.0.0
dependencies:
  - name: openebs-monitoring
    version: 0.4.8
    repository: "https://openebs.github.io/monitoring/"
    condition: openebs-monitoring.install
````

In the file **values.yaml**, you will define your configuration for the monitoring stack.  

If you defined a **dependency condition** in **Chart.yaml**, you will have to define the value in that condition.  In this example, the condition name is `openebs-monitoring.install`.  

if you provide only the condition value, you will deploy OpenEBS monitoring stack with the default values provided in there chart.

####value.yaml (with default values)
````yaml
openebs-monitoring:
  install: true
````

#### value.yaml (with ingress and storage)

To use storage for the monitoring stack, you will have to create the storage class before using it.  In this example, I use a storage class named : `sc-metrics`.

For ingress, I used a domain name : `dev.dynamic.cluster109.local`

The applications will be accessible from :
- http://dev.dynamic.cluster109.local/prometheus
- http://dev.dynamic.cluster109.local/grafana
- http://dev.dynamic.cluster109.local/alertmanager

Here the content of **values.yaml** with those settings.

````yaml
openebs-monitoring:
  install: true

# How to deploy the umbrella chart

### Download the dependencies
The first step will be to download the dependencies by running this command in a terminal in the umbrella folder.     

````console
helm dep build
````

If you had already ran that command and you changed the dependencies in Chart.yaml, you will have to download the new dependencies by running this command.

````console
helm dep up
````

You will obtain that folder structure

```
ðŸ“¦umbrella
 â”£ ðŸ“‚charts
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œopenebs-monitoring-0.4.8.tgz
 â”£ ðŸ“‚templates
 â”£ ðŸ“œChart.lock
 â”£ ðŸ“œChart.yaml
 â”— ðŸ“œvalues.yaml
```

### Install the chart

#### From the umbrella folder

In a terminal in the umbrella folder run this command :

```console
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] . -n  [NAMESPACE] --create-namespace
```

ex :
````console
helm install monitoring . -n monitoring --create-namespace
````

#### From a helm chart repository

In a terminal in the umbrella folder run this command :

```console
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] [REPOSITORY]/[CHART_NAME] -n  [NAMESPACE]  --create-namespace
```

ex : 
````console
helm install monitoring chartmuseum/monitoring-stack -n monitoring --create-namespace
````
